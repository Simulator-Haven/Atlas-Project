# Atlas-Project
The Atlas Project is a 3D mapping project for the Starbase community.

There are various goals for this project, the ones listed below being the main goals.

(1) A functional 3D map of the SB solar system where anyone can access a read only copy and look around.
  (1-A) A search function and tag system to find points of interest.
  (1-B) Semi open source. Anyone can submit information to be added to the map that then gets validated by a trusted member of the project. Or if that is to limiting completely open source with secure backups in case of trolling.
  (1-C) A fully functional website to host the interactible map on. Potentially with users having the ability to make profiles so the can favorite certain locations and draw custome things (like trade routes) on the map.

(2) Figure out how to make a version of the map in-game so that it can be interacted/viewed by players there. Likely as a non-interactable hologram or a set of 2D maps with custom symbols to show depth.
